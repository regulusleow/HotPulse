| Skill | Description | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **brainstorming** | Use when creating or developing, before writing code or implementation plans - refines rough ideas into fully-formed designs through collaborative questioning, alternative exploration, and incremental validation. Don't use during clear 'mechanical' processes | `.cursor/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` |
| **condition-based-waiting** | Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or inconsistent pass/fail behavior - replaces arbitrary timeouts with condition polling to wait for actual state changes, eliminating flaky tests from timing guesses | `.cursor/skills/condition-based-waiting/SKILL.md` |
| **defense-in-depth** | Use when invalid data causes failures deep in execution, requiring validation at multiple system layers - validates at every layer data passes through to make bugs structurally impossible | `.cursor/skills/defense-in-depth/SKILL.md` |
| **dispatching-parallel-agents** | Use when facing 3+ independent failures that can be investigated without shared state or dependencies - dispatches multiple Claude agents to investigate and fix independent problems concurrently | `.cursor/skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md` |
| **executing-plans** | Use when partner provides a complete implementation plan to execute in controlled batches with review checkpoints - loads plan, reviews critically, executes tasks in batches, reports for review between batches | `.cursor/skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md` |
| **finishing-a-development-branch** | Use when implementation is complete, all tests pass, and you need to decide how to integrate the work - guides completion of development work by presenting structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup | `.cursor/skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md` |
| **receiving-code-review** | Use when receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable - requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation | `.cursor/skills/receiving-code-review/SKILL.md` |
| **requesting-code-review** | Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements - dispatches superpowers:code-reviewer subagent to review implementation against plan or requirements before proceeding | `.cursor/skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md` |
| **root-cause-tracing** | Use when errors occur deep in execution and you need to trace back to find the original trigger - systematically traces bugs backward through call stack, adding instrumentation when needed, to identify source of invalid data or incorrect behavior | `.cursor/skills/root-cause-tracing/SKILL.md` |
| **sharing-skills** | Use when you've developed a broadly useful skill and want to contribute it upstream via pull request - guides process of branching, committing, pushing, and creating PR to contribute skills back to upstream repository | `.cursor/skills/sharing-skills/SKILL.md` |
| **subagent-driven-development** | Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session - dispatches fresh subagent for each task with code review between tasks, enabling fast iteration with quality gates | `.cursor/skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` |
| **systematic-debugging** | Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes - four-phase framework (root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation) that ensures understanding before attempting solutions | `.cursor/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` |
| **test-driven-development** | Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code - write the test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass; ensures tests actually verify behavior by requiring failure first | `.cursor/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` |
| **testing-anti-patterns** | Use when writing or changing tests, adding mocks, or tempted to add test-only methods to production code - prevents testing mock behavior, production pollution with test-only methods, and mocking without understanding dependencies | `.cursor/skills/testing-anti-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| **testing-skills-with-subagents** | Use when creating or editing skills, before deployment, to verify they work under pressure and resist rationalization - applies RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle to process documentation by running baseline without skill, writing to address failures, iterating to close loopholes | `.cursor/skills/testing-skills-with-subagents/SKILL.md` |
| **using-git-worktrees** | Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification | `.cursor/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md` |
| **using-superpowers** | Use when starting any conversation - establishes mandatory workflows for finding and using skills, including using Skill tool before announcing usage, following brainstorming before coding, and creating TodoWrite todos for checklists | `.cursor/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` |
| **verification-before-completion** | Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always | `.cursor/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md` |
| **writing-plans** | Use when design is complete and you need detailed implementation tasks for engineers with zero codebase context - creates comprehensive implementation plans with exact file paths, complete code examples, and verification steps assuming engineer has minimal domain knowledge | `.cursor/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md` |
| **writing-skills** | Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment - applies TDD to process documentation by testing with subagents before writing, iterating until bulletproof against rationalization | `.cursor/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` |
